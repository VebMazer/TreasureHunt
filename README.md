# TreasureHunt
A very simple game project made using pygame as part of a python programming course.

The player must collect all the coins and then escape through the exit on each level, while avoiding monsters and rocks that get in the way.

Python packages required:
- pygame
- numpy
- line-segment-intersections

The pictures in the game come from the course exercise materials:
